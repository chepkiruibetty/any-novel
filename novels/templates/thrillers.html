                    <p class="card-text">Emily Harlow is a professional organizer who helps people declutter their
                        lives; she’s married to man who can’t drive past a yard sale without stopping. He’s filled their
                        basement, attic, and garage with his finds.
                        Like other professionals who make a living decluttering peoples’ lives, Emily has devised a set
                        of ironclad rules. When working with couples, she makes clear that the client is only allowed to
                        declutter his or her own stuff. That stipulation has kept Emily’s own marriage together these
                        past few years. She’d love nothing better than to toss out all her husband’s crap. He says he’s
                        a collector. Emily knows better—he’s a hoarder. The larger his “collection” becomes, the deeper
                        the distance grows between Emily and the man she married..</p>

                        Sara comes a thrilling psychological drama about a woman who believes she escaped a brutal
                        murder years ago—but does anyone else believe her?

                        Sienna Scott grew up in the dark shadow of her mother’s paranoid delusions. Now, she's returned
                        home to confront her past and the unsolved murder that altered the course of her life.

                        In her mother’s shuttered house, an old fear that has haunted Sienna for years rears its ugly
                        head —that it was she who had been the killer’s target that night. And now, with it, a new
                        fear—that the killer not only intended to remedy his past mistake—he’s already begun. But are
                        these fears any different from the ones that torment her mother?
